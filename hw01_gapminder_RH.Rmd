```


Looking at the life expectancy for Canada where population size is indicated by the size of the points

```{r}
s <- round(filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada"))$pop/10^6.5)
p <- ggplot(filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Canada")),
            aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(size = s, shape = 18, color = "dark blue")
```


Plotting life expectancy and population by continent shows that Europe has higher life expectancies while Africa and Asia have lower. 
```{r}
q <- ggplot(filter(gapminder, year %in% 1962:1990),
       aes(y = lifeExp, x = pop, color = continent)) 
q <- q + scale_x_log10()
q + geom_point(shape = 19)

```
