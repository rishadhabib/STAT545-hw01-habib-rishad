####Reporting my process:
- I started a new homework project
- where I cloned my github repo
- edited locally  
- saved, commited 
- and pushed to github

Editing the Readme document was fun especially adding emojis :smiley: and images

The [R Markdown document] (/hw01_gapminder_RH.md) was created in the same project, saved, knitted, committed, pulled and pushed to github.
